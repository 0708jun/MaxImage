## Past Fork Notes
re: alancwoo - Added the ability to use a data-href attribute on the images. Thus one can now use this attribute for various things such as jquery tooltips, click functions etc.

## Changelog:

Version 2.0:
* Fixed compatibility with older browsers, specifically a bug that was creating white space after browser resize

Version 2.0-beta3:
* Added ability to add other HTML within Slides (still to be tested in pre-CSS3 browsers)
